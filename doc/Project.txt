### Introduction

## What is Geofencing?

Geofence is a virtual “fence” perimeter around a physical location. Geofences can detect whether a user has entered or exited the perimeter. 

## Concept

* Creating an app that is aware of the user's location and user's proximity to specific locations.

## History

This project began development in late 2017 as a College Thesis project. It is also my very first Android project that I've ever written. We had about 11 month of development time and managed to successfully defend this project. After we have successfully completed our thesis, we have decided to open source our project in hopes that any developer, big or small can take our project and implement it in their own ways.
