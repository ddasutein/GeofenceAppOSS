# GeofenceAppOSS

Welcome to my Geofence project. This was a project that started in 2017 with a group of four as part of the Bachelors of Science in Computer Science Thesis program. After a successful demo, we have decided to open source the project for anyone to use for their own projects or existing application. Contributions are welcome.

## Compatibility

I have tested this application with Android 6.0, 7.0, 7.1 and 8.1 and it functions as intended. Please note that this app is not targetting API Level 26 (Android 8.0) and later. 

## Get your Google Maps API key

To enable Maps functionality, you must obtain an API key. Please follow instructions in this guide on how to get your own API key. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

Once you get your API key, copy and paste it in the AndroidManifest.xml file

## How to mock locations?

I recommend you download the GPS JoySTick Fake GPS app from the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theappninjas.gpsjoystick&hl=en
